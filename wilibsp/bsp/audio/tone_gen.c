// Pure sine generator. The first sample is taken at a half-step phase offset so
// the sample grid is centered on the sine: one full period then shows both of its
// zero crossings inside the window rather than pinning sample 0 exactly to zero
// (which hides the rising crossing at the period boundary). *phase is advanced by
// n steps so successive calls stay phase-continuous.
